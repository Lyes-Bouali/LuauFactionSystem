**FactionSystem.rbxm**
- This is the **main file** you want to download. Put this into Roblox Studio and unpackage each of the folders in the designated spot they're titled.
- Look at the notes packaged with the file for an example.

**Faction Module, Data Store, GUI Interactions, RBXM Notes**:
- This is a compilation of the scripts that are **already inside** the **FactionSystem.rbxm**, they are simply placed here so you may view the script contents without downloading the project file and downloading Roblox Studio, if necessary.
