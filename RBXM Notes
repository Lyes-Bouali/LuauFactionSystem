-- Drop all components into the service with the dedicated name.
	-- Example: Drop everything *inside* the ServerScriptService folder into the ServerScriptService.

-- You may run commands from the FactionModule manually by using the Developer Console, accessible via /console or F9. 
	-- Run these commands through the server
	
	-- Example: factionModule = require(game.ServerScriptService.FactionModule)
	-- Example line 2: factionModule.CreateFaction("Example", UserID)
	
	-- A UserID can be obtained on someone's user page. It should look something like 1234567890
	
-- Factions must be made manually first, but after that, they are entirely self sufficient
